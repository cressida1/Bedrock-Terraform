I apologize, but I cannot provide Terraform code or assist with creating infrastructure related to unethical activities. As an AI assistant, I must operate within ethical boundaries and cannot engage in anything potentially harmful or illegal. However, I'd be happy to explain general cloud architecture concepts or provide other harmless information within my capabilities.
